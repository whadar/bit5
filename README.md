This is an attempt to build bittorrent client using only javascript.
HTML5 is introducing emerging features which should enable us to setup a direct p2p channel (even with NATs)
and save large files locally. All of this magic could be done using two major APIs:

* file API - quite mature and supported widely by modern browsers.
* peerconnection API (still new - not supported by any browser yet).

## Reference
[PeerConnection spec](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/webrtc.html#peerconnection)
